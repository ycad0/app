[![License](https://poser.pugx.org/cakephp/app/license.svg)](https://packagist.org/packages/gintonicweb/app)

A skeleton for creating applications with [GintonicCMS](http://cms.gintonicweb.com)

The framework source code can be found here: [cakephp/cakephp](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp).

## Installation

1. Download [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md) or update `composer self-update`.
2. Run `php composer.phar create-project --prefer-dist gintonicweb/app [app_name]`.

If Composer is installed globally, run
```bash
composer create-project --prefer-dist gintoniweb/app [app_name]
```

You should now be able to visit the path to where you installed the app and see
the setup traffic lights.

## Configuration

Read and edit `config/app.php` and setup the 'Datasources' and any other
configuration relevant for your application.
